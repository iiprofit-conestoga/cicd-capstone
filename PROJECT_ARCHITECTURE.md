# CI/CD Pipeline Project - Comprehensive Application Deployment

## Project Overview
This project implements a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for deploying a full-stack web application using modern cloud technologies and best practices. The application consists of a frontend, backend, and database, all deployed on AWS using infrastructure as code and automated deployment pipelines.

## Infrastructure Components

### VPC Configuration
- Public and private subnets
- NAT Gateway for private subnet access
- Internet Gateway for public access
- Security Groups for component isolation

### ECS Configuration
- Separate clusters for frontend and backend
- Task definitions for container specifications
- Service definitions for deployment configuration
- Auto-scaling policies

### Load Balancing
- Application Load Balancer for frontend
- Internal ALB for backend
- Health check configurations
- SSL/TLS termination

### Database
- RDS instance in private subnet
- Automated backups
- Multi-AZ deployment
- Security group configurations

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Jenkins Pipeline Stages
1. **Source Stage**
   - Git checkout
   - Branch validation
   - Code review integration

2. **Build Stage**
   - Frontend build
   - Backend build
   - Docker image creation
   - Push to ECR

3. **Test Stage**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Security scanning
   - Code coverage analysis

4. **Infrastructure Stage**
   - Terraform init
   - Terraform plan
   - Terraform apply
   - Infrastructure validation

5. **Deploy Stage**
   - Deploy frontend to ECS
   - Deploy backend to ECS
   - Database migrations
   - Health checks

## Monitoring and Logging

### CloudWatch Configuration
1. **Metrics**
   - ECS service metrics
   - ALB metrics
   - RDS metrics
   - Custom application metrics

2. **Logs**
   - Container logs
   - Application logs
   - ALB logs
   - RDS logs

3. **Alerts**
   - High CPU/Memory usage
   - Error rate thresholds
   - Service health
   - Cost alerts

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- VPC isolation
- Security groups
- NACLs
- Private subnets for sensitive resources

### Application Security
